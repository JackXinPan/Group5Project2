# Project Introduction

![](/static/img/phytoplankon.jpg) 

Around 70 percent of planet covers by the oceans.  This little plant-like microscopic cells, Phytoplankton, are floating around the ocean transforming carbon dioxide, sunlight, and nutrients into organic matter.  Not only it takes in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it also sits at a bottom of food chain to all sea creatures.  Location and amount of phytoplankton affects everything from zooplankton, krill, shellfish, fish to whales.

From the space, satellites can detect the intensity of the colour pigments in the water.  Itâ€™s still difficult to understand what is happening below the surface, which is why analysing the samples collecting from the oceans help scientist to understand them.  The samples could be captured more than 5000 metres below sea surface, nutrient concentrations, ocean temperature, amount of phytoplankton and zooplankton can be measured.

Plankton blooms are one of the top biological events that are recorded each year.  It can be seen by satellite images measuring the ocean pigmentation.  Weather, climate change, amount of sediments entering the ocean can affect the size , time and location where the blooms happen.

Duration of dataset showing in the application will be smaller compared to raw data to accomodate a processing time when run in the application

# Analysis


![](/static/img/satellite.jpg) 

![](/static/img/chlorophyll_temperature.jpg) 
Microscopy and electron microscopy have been used when specimen the species of phytoplankton and zooplankton throughout the years.  As the scientists gain more knowledge to distinguish smaller phytoplankton, a larger number of taxon group can be detected from the dataset.  
Some taxon groups could be seen more than another.  However in a certain years, there are only few taxon groups found.  The changes of phytoplankton and zooplankton production still remain unclear as other variables such as ocean temperature, climate changes , CO2 emission, plankton migration and adaptability of the species should be taken into account.  Those factors play an important role controlling plankton ecosystems.
